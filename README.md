## Mini-LOL Compiler

This program is a "compiler" written in Java. It scans and parses an input file
according to the grammer rules for Mini-LOL - a smaller version of the mock
language LOL with simplified grammer rules. It was created for the
CS 4324 - Compiler Construction course at the University of Oklahoma.

To compile and run the project, use

    javac parser/*.java
    java parser.MiniLOLCompiler data/input.txt
